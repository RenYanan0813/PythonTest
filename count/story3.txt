I see the sun dripping from the sky

Into my eyes

Into my eyes
The pavements crackly down the road

Where do I go

Where do I go

And I dont know
If you know

That I go nowhere

Through in Candor




I wish that I could spend my day

I don know where

I don know where

The sunday morning I home

But I never ramble

No I never ramble

And I dont

If you know

That I

Through in Canada
